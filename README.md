Hotel Bookings Analysis Project

This project was completed as part of my internship at Codtech IT Solutions, where I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel bookings dataset. The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could help optimize hotel management strategies.

 Project Overview

The analysis involved a comprehensive study of booking patterns, customer demographics, and stay durations. By examining this data, I identified key trends that are crucial for decision-making in the hotel industry.

 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas & NumPy: To clean, process, and analyze the dataset.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and insights.

Key Insights

- Occupancy Trends: Seasonal booking patterns and peak periods were identified, aiding in resource planning.
- Customer Preferences: Analysis of booking lead time and cancellation behaviors provided actionable insights for improving customer retention.
- Strategic Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions were made to optimize booking management and improve operational efficiency.

Challenges Faced

- Data Quality: Addressed issues with missing and inconsistent data through effective data cleaning techniques.
- Feature Engineering: Implemented to improve the quality of the analysis and the relevance of the insights.

 Conclusion

This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided valuable experience in applying data science to real-world business problems. The insights derived from this analysis can significantly impact hotel management strategies and decision-making processes.
